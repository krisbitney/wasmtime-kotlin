Improve memory safety
 - encapsulate as many types as possible within the kotlin type system (create types then delete the underlying C types)
 - create a wasmtimeScope function that creates a scope for the lifetime of wasmtime types.
 it should add types to a queue and then close the queue at the end of the scope.

Improve thread safety
 - review headers for thread safety guidelines
 - implement thread safety where possible

Add KDoc documentation comments

Add tests

Configure build script
 - download correct wasmtime C library for each platform
 - publish build artifacts for each target to maven central
